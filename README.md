## About

**Sachin Thomas**  
*Ph.D. Candidate in Economics*  
University of Washington, Seattle

I am a Ph.D. candidate specializing in **International Macroeconomics**, **Banking**, and **Financial Markets**. My research examines the dynamics of capital flows and their impact on banking stability and economic performance. Specifically, I aim to contribute to frameworks that enhance financial stability and inform policy decisions within the context of a globalized financial system.

## Research

### Sudden Stops And Bank Competition (Job Market Paper)
**Download**  
This study investigates the implications of sudden stops on the competitive landscape of the banking sector. Using data for 46 emerging economies, I find evidence of reduced banking competition following a sudden stop episode. The paper employs a small open economy model with banks facing imperfect competition and occasionally binding collateral constraints. The entry and exit of banks influence the market power of existing incumbents, and a contraction in the banking sector due to reduced external funding increases market concentration and empowers surviving institutions to raise loan rates, thereby amplifying borrowing costs for firms and households.

### Bank Heterogeneity And Imperfect Competition
**Download**  
This paper develops a DSGE open economy model featuring a banking sector with heterogeneous banks, characterized by a Pareto distribution of productivity and subject to binding collateral constraints on foreign borrowing. I explore how bank productivity heterogeneity interacts with external financing conditions, affecting credit supply, firm investment, and macroeconomic stability. The analysis also delves into the dynamic responses to key shocks, including sudden stops in capital flows, changes in central bank interest rates, and adjustments in bank entry and operational costs.
